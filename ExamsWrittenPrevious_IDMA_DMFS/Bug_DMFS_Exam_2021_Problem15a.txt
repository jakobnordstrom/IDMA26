Bug in solutions for pset 5

Hi all,

Some students have had problems with parsing the solution to problem 4a on problem set 5.

It turns out that the claim about the grammar being an LL(2) grammar is incorrect.

I have to confess that I constructed this problem a bit too quickly a bit too late at night before last year's exam, and tagged on the question about the number of characters of look-ahead because it seemed like a nice extra question. However, the parser I had in mind will not gracefully deal with superfluous parantheses. For instance, with two characters of look-ahead it is difficult to tell apart "(num) + num" and "(num)", and adding more parantheses will make this even harder.

I apologize for this error. But if you are one of the students who got stuck on this, then I think this is very good news --- chances are that you are excellently prepared for the exam.

Best regards,
Jakob
