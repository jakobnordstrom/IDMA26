IDEAS FOR PROBLEM SETS FOR IDMA 2026
====================================

In 2025 I just recycled the problem sets for 2022.

Sources of problems for 2026:
(a) Exam problems in 2025



PROBLEM SET 1
1. Representation of numbers
2. Euclidean algorithm
3. Simple pseudocode
4. More complicated pseudocode

PROBLEM SET 2
1. Simple induction proofs
2. Propositional logic
3. Buggy induction proofs
*** Add problem on "mergerunssort" with example & analysis? ***

PROBLEM SET 3
1. Relations: identifying different types of relations
2. Tricky induction proof about Fibonacci numbers
3. Combinatorics problem (DNRF centre application)
4. Matrix multiplication and eigenvalues

PROBLEM SET 4
1. Shortest path
2. Graph traversals: identify different orders
*** Should I add one more problem? ***

PLANNING FOR THE EXAM 2026
==========================

Pseudocode? (Didn't have this last year)

Some induction problem

Merge sort problem
This was a long time ago now

Exactly the same kind of relations problem?!
Or do something that also involves closure?

Propositional logic
Exactly the same kind of patching problem?

Combinatorics: Something?

Graphs: Identify traversals
Maybe exactly the same type of problem as last year?

Graphs: Maybe strongly connected components

- Start with directed graph and view graph as edge relation.
- Maybe even give small graph on 6 or 7 vertices as example
- Take transitive closure T  of this relation. What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Take reflexive closure R of (a). What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Define new relation S(u,v) such at S(u,v) holds precisely with R(u,v) and R(v,u) holds. This gives a particular type of relation that we discussed in class. What is this type of relation called? Prove that we indeed get this type of relation.
- In fact, we have even seen an algorithm for computing this relation. Run this algorithm on our small example graph, in the same way as we did in class, 

But this is probably very hard...


PLANNING FOR THE EXAM 2025
==========================

1. Representation of numbers
- Write the binary number 110 in decimal notation.
- Write the decimal number 110 in binary notation.
- Suppose that 2025 is an octal number. Write it in decimal notation.

2. Run Euclidean algorithm on two suitably large numbers M and N. Find d = GCD(M, N) and write it as a linear combination of M and N.
Fibonacci numbers are good, rescaled along the way to get more interesting calculations

3. INDUCTION PROOFS

Some induction problem from Vaderlind? Ask ChatGPT?

4. RELATIONS

Identify different properties of relations

5. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC

Ask students to patch formulas in simplest way possible to get tautologies

6. TRICKY INDUCTION PROBLEM

7. COMBINATORICS

Ways of organizing DNRF application aspects

8. SHORTEST PATH

9. IDENTIFY TRAVERSALS
