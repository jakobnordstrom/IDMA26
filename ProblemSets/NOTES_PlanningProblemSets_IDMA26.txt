IDEAS FOR PROBLEM SETS FOR IDMA 2026
====================================

In 2025 I just recycled the problem sets for 2022.

Sources of problems for 2026:
(a) Exam problems in 2025
(b) DMFS 2023 problem set 4 problem 3 (really hard)
(c) Old note: DMFS 2023 pset 5:3 would be an option, but maybe we will save this for next year?


PROBLEM SET 1

- Euclidean algorithm
- Representation of numbers
- Pseudocode




CANDIDATES TO SAVE FOR THE EXAM 2025
====================================

Which of these did I already use for the IDMA exam in 2024?

1. PSEUDOCODE

Or no?

Maybe:

1. Run Euclidean algorithm on two suitably large numbers M and N. Find d = GCD(M, N) and write it as a linear combination of M and N.
Fibonacci numbers are good, rescaled along the way to get more interesting calculations

M = 117
N = 69

2. Representation of numbers
- Write the binary number 110 in decimal notation.
- Write the decimal number 110 in binary notation.
- Suppose that 2025 is an octal number. Write it in decimal notation.

3. SORTING

We had a heap sort problem in 2024

4. RELATIONS

In 2024 we had the relation < over 6 elements

5. GRAPHS

In 2024 we had:
- a scheduling problem
- a graph isomorphism problem

Maybe strongly connected components

- Start with directed graph and view graph as edge relation.
- Maybe even give small graph on 6 or 7 vertices as example
- Take transitive closure T  of this relation. What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Take reflexive closure R of (a). What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Define new relation S(u,v) such at S(u,v) holds precisely with R(u,v) and R(v,u) holds. This gives a particular type of relation that we discussed in class. What is this type of relation called? Prove that we indeed get this type of relation.
- In fact, we have even seen an algorithm for computing this relation. Run this algorithm on our small example graph, in the same way as we did in class, 

But this is probably very hard...


6. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC
Ask students to patch formulas in simplest way possible to get tautologies?
Something more creative than just producing truth tables...

7. A COUPLE OF SIMPLE INDUCTION PROBLEMS

(Not the ones in the 2024 exam)
Some induction problem from Vaderlind?

Recall that the Fibonacci numbers are defined as

F_1 = F_2 = 1 and
F_n = F_{n - 1} +  F_{n - 2} for n >= 3.
Prove that the Fibonacci numbers F_{n+1} and F_n are relatively prime, and that for n >= 2 the
Euclidean algorithm for F_{n+1} and F_n takes n-1 steps to determine this fact (i.e., it reaches remainder 0 after exactly n-1 steps)



Prove that for all n >=1 the number 4^n + 5 is divisible by 3

Define a_1 = 1, a_n = 2 a_{n-1} + 1. Prove that for all n a_n = 2^n - 1.



8. COMBINATORICS
