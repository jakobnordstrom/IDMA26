PLANNING OF PROBLEM SETS FOR IDMA 2026
======================================

In 2025 I just recycled the problem sets for 2022.
In 2026 I used:
- Exam problems in 2025.
- Some old, hard problems from DMFS 2023 problem sets and the DMFS 2021 exam.
- A few new problems.

*** In 2027, should I recycle the DMFS 2023 problems, and get rid   ***
*** of all traces of the DMFS course once and for all?              ***
*** (And also use exam 2026 problems, of course.)                   ***
*** The DMFS 2022 exam problems are anyway on the 2023 problem set. ***
*** The DMFS 2023 exam problems are anyway on the 2024 problem set. ***


PROBLEM SET 1 2026
1. Representation of numbers
2. Euclidean algorithm
3. Simple pseudocode
4. More complicated pseudocode

PROBLEM SET 2 2026
1. Simple induction proofs
2. Propositional logic
3. Merge runs sort algorithm that runs in quadratic time
4. Buggy induction proofs (DMFS 2023 problem set 5, problem 3)

PROBLEM SET 3
1. Relations: identifying different types of relations
2. Tricky induction proof about Fibonacci numbers
3. Combinatorics problem (DNRF centre application)
4. Matrix multiplication and eigenvalues (DMFS 2023 problem set 4, problem 3)

PROBLEM SET 4
1. Shortest path
2. Graph traversals: identify different orders
3. Combinatorics problem about radio cars (DMFS exam 2021)
4. Combinatorics problem about legos (DMFS exam 2021)


PLANNING FOR THE EXAM 2026
==========================

Pseudocode? (Didn't have this last year)
Maybe have algorithms for
- insertion in a doubly linked list
- removal in a doubly linked list
- lookup in a doubly linked list
and ask to match the code snippets to these alternatives (with explanations).
All code snippets would "return" something just to obfuscate a little bit.

Some induction problem: Try to come with something with genAI?

Combinatorics: Try to come with something with genAI?

Merge sort problem
This was a long time ago now

Exactly the same kind of relations problem?!
Or do something that also involves closure?

Propositional logic
Exactly the same kind of patching problem?

Graphs: Identify traversals
Maybe exactly the same type of problem as last year?

Graphs: Maybe strongly connected components

- Start with directed graph and view graph as edge relation.
- Maybe even give small graph on 6 or 7 vertices as example
- Take transitive closure T  of this relation. What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Take reflexive closure R of (a). What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Define new relation S(u,v) such at S(u,v) holds precisely with R(u,v) and R(v,u) holds. This gives a particular type of relation that we discussed in class. What is this type of relation called? Prove that we indeed get this type of relation.
- In fact, we have even seen an algorithm for computing this relation. Run this algorithm on our small example graph, in the same way as we did in class, 

But this is probably very hard...


PLANNING FOR THE EXAM 2025
==========================

1. Representation of numbers
- Write the binary number 110 in decimal notation.
- Write the decimal number 110 in binary notation.
- Suppose that 2025 is an octal number. Write it in decimal notation.

2. Run Euclidean algorithm on two suitably large numbers M and N. Find d = GCD(M, N) and write it as a linear combination of M and N.
Fibonacci numbers are good, rescaled along the way to get more interesting calculations

3. INDUCTION PROOFS

Some simple induction problems

4. RELATIONS

Identify different properties of relations

5. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC

Ask students to patch formulas in simplest way possible to get tautologies

6. TRICKY INDUCTION PROBLEM

7. COMBINATORICS

Ways of organizing DNRF application aspects

8. SHORTEST PATH

9. IDENTIFY TRAVERSALS
