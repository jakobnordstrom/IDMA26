GRADING GUIDELINES FOR IDMA 2025 PROBLEM SET 1
==============================================


PROBLEM 1 (60 p)

PROBLEM 1a (30 p)
Clear display of understanding, but description not fully correct -10 p
Display of some kind of relevant understanding, but description is vague or incorrect - 20 p
"Explanation" is just a code-line-to-words translation; no essential difference from pseudocode: -25 p
Just a brief answer what the algorithm does with no explanation of or connection to the pseudocode: -25 p

PROBLEM 1b (10 p)
General grading guidelines for this type of 60 = 30 + 10 + 20 problems:
- Correct answer but not full justification (why n^2)? -5 p
- Big-oh notation including also lower-order terms: 0 p
- Unclear answer that does not clearly state complexity O(n^2) 0 p
- Just stating the time complexity without any motivation 0 p
Students need to provide a clear argument about the number of iterations. It is not sufficient to just state O(n^2) --- we want to see that the students understand that the number of iterations is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... and that this is O(n^2)
Students don’t need to prove Omega(n^2), but it is a bonus to provide an argument for a matching lower bound for the algorithm.

PROBLEM 1c (20 p; 15 p for optimal algorithm; 5 p for proof of optimality)
General grading guidelines for this type of problems:
- Improvement only by constant factor, not asymptotically 5 p
- Asymptotic improvement, but not optimal 10 p
- Essentially optimal solution, but off-by-one errors or similar in code -5 p
- Some meaningful attempt at improvement that displays some understanding, but details wrong -10 p
- Nowhere in the full solution of the problem is there enough information to display that the student understands what the pseudocode does -10 p
- Missing argument for optimality (i.e., linear time is needed to read the input and compute the output) -5 p


PROBLEM 2 (60 p)

PROBLEM 2a (30 p)
Clear display of understanding, but description not fully correct -10 p
Display of some kind of relevant understanding, but description is vague or incorrect -20 p
Just a brief answer what the algorithm does with no explanation of or connection to the pseudocode: -25 p
"Explanation" is just a code-line-to-words translation; no essential difference from pseudocode: -25 p
For a full score, we need a clear statement that "success" means that A is sorted.

PROBLEM 2b (10 p)
General grading guidelines for this type of 60 = 30 + 10 + 20 problems:
- Correct answer but not full justification (why n^2)? -5 p
- Big-oh notation including also lower-order terms: 0 p
- Unclear answer that does not clearly state complexity O(n^2) 0 p
- Just stating the time complexity without any motivation 0 p
Students need to provide a clear argument about the number of iterations. It is not sufficient to just state O(n^2) --- we want to see that the students understand that the number of iterations worst-case is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... and that this is O(n^2)
Students don’t need to prove Omega(n^2), but it is a bonus to provide an argument for a matching lower bound for the algorithm.

PROBLEM 2c (20 p; 15 p for optimal algorithm; 5 p for proof of optimality)
General grading guidelines for this type of problems:
- Improvement only by constant factor, not asymptotically 5 p
- Asymptotic improvement, but not optimal 10 p
- Essentially optimal solution, but off-by-one errors or similar in code -5 p
- Some meaningful attempt at improvement that displays some understanding, but details wrong -10 p
- Nowhere in the full solution of the problem is there enough information to display that the student understands what the pseudocode does -10 p
- Missing argument for optimality (i.e., linear time is needed to read the input and compute the output) -5 p


PROBLEM 3 (80 p)

PROBLEM 3a (40 p)
Clear display of understanding, but description not fully correct -10 p
Display of some kind of relevant understanding, but description is vague or incorrect - 20 p
Just a brief answer what the algorithm does with no explanation of or connection to the pseudocode: -25 p
No explanation of out-of-bounds check (but otherwise OK) -5 p
No explanation of what the B array is used for (but otherwise OK) -5 p
Explanation of main algorithm mostly correct except for other details than specified above -5 p
Correct answer, but explanation does not make any sense: -35 p
"Explanation" is just a code-line-to-words translation; no essential difference from pseudocode: -35 p

PROBLEM 3b (20 p)
Correct answer 2n^2 O(n^2)but only claim of "nested loops" -10 p
No explanation why inner while loop runs in linear time -5 p
Big-oh notation including also lower-order terms: -15 p
Unclear answer that does not clearly state complexity O(n^2) 0 p
Just stating the time complexity without any motivation 0 p

PROBLEM 3c (20 p; 15 p for optimal algorithm; 5 p for proof of optimality)
General grading guidelines for this type of problems:
- Improvement only by constant factor, not asymptotically 5 p
- Asymptotic improvement, but not optimal 10 p
- Essentially optimal solution, but off-by-one errors or similar in code -5 p
- Some meaningful attempt at improvement that displays some understanding, but details wrong -10 p
- Nowhere in the full soluton of the problem is there enough information to display that the student understands what the pseudocode does -10 p
- Missing argument for optimality (i.e., linear time is needed to read the input and compute the output) -5 p


PROBLEM 4 (80 p)

PROBLEM 4a (40 p)
Clear display of understanding, but description not fully correct -10 p
Display of some kind of relevant understanding, but description is vague or incorrect - 20 p
Explanation of main algorithm correct except for minor details -5 p
Correct answer, but explanation does not make any sense: -35 p
"Explanation" is just a code-line-to-words translation; no essential difference from pseudocode: -35 p

PROBLEM 4b (20 p)
Missing argument why algorithm terminates -5 p
Correct answer O(log n) but missing justification (i.e., that recursive call essentially halves size of input) -10 p
Correct but non-tight upper bound O(n^2) with convincing argument: 10 p
Correct but non-tight upper bound O(n^2) with not-so-convincing argument: 5 p
Big-oh notation including also lower-order terms: -15 p
Time complexity analysis fails to consider recursion: 0 p

PROBLEM 4c (20 p)
Claim that "failure" can be returned also for recursive calls -5p
Claim that element distinctness is sufficient -5p
Claim that sortedness is sufficient -5p
Correct claim that sortedness + distinctness required, but missing justification -5 p
