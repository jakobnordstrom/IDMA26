PROBLEM 1: COMBINATORICS (100 p)

PROBLEM 1a (40 p)
Correct calculations but no explanation (why do we get binomial coefficients?): 10 p
Realizes #turns is what matters; but calculations messed up: 20 p
Answering with a count of the number of ways, not a probability: 20 p
Dividing by the total number of outcomes, but no explanation that this is what is happening: -10 p
Correct formula with explanation of derivation, but no answer as to which end vertex is most likely: -20 p
Only correct answer, nothing else: 0 p  

PROBLEM 1b (60 p)
Correct calculations but no explanation (why do we get binomial coefficients?): 10 p
Only gives a recursion like f[L][j]=f[L-1][j]+f[L-1][j-1], but no final answer: 10 p
Explanation that the walk is most likely to end up in the middle + formula with binomial coefficients, but no more details in solution: 20 p
Showing calculations visually via Pascal’s triangle, but not explaining what these calculations are and/or why they make sense: 20 p
Correct calculations, but explanations are sketchy and/or hard to follow: -20 p
Minor calculation errors, e.g., mixing up layers L and L-1: -10 p
Dividing by the total number of outcomes, but no explanation that this is what is happening: -15 p
Not dividing by the total number of outcomes: -20 p
Only correct answer, nothing else: 0 p
Only doing problem 1b, but then using this solution to read off and motivate fully correct solution to problem 1a: Full score on both subproblems.
Parts of the general reasoning for problem 1b presented already in the solution to problem 1a and then not repeated again: Graded as if the information was present for both subproblems.    


PROBLEM 2: GRAPH THEORY [MINIMUM SPANNING TREES] (80 p)

PROBLEM 2a (50 p)
[Correct heaps 20 p; correct algorithm with relaxations 20 p, correct MST 10 p]
Completely missing heap and/or completely misunderstood heap representation: -20 p
Heap only updated once all relaxations have been made for a dequeued vertex (and so becomes incorrect): -10 p
Partially missing details for heap: -5 p
Derivations for heap due to wrong initial order (not alphabetic): -1 p [i.e., very minor issue]
No details on "relax" operations: -20 p
Partially missing or wrong details for relax operations (e.g., failing to explain/point out which edges lead to updates or not): -10 p
Partially missing details for minimum spanning tree: -5 p
Missing most or all details for MST: -10 p
Refers to the queue as a stack: -10 p
Deviations due to non-lexicographic order of neighbours: -1 p [i.e., very minor issue]

PROBLEM 2b (30 p)
[Pointing out that algorithm is wrong 15 p; pointing out that time complexity is wrong 15 p]
Clear counter-example to algorithm: 15 p
Fairly convincing argument that the algorithm does not seem correct (e.g., it does not add safe edges): 10 p
Claim that algorithm is incorrect with some kind of motivation headed in right direction: 5 p
Clear argument why time complexity is wrong (like: not constant time per edge): 15 p
Fairly convincing argument why time complexity is wrong: 10 p
Claim that time complexity is wrong with some kind of motivation headed in right direction: 5 p
Only correct answers, nothing else: 0 p


PROBLEM 3: GRAPH THEORY [GRAPH TRAVERSAL]

PROBLEM 3a (30 p)
Minor mistakes during graph traversal (such as missing discovery and finishing times): -10 p
Overall correct approach but some mistakes: -15 p
Correct spanning tree but almost all details missing: -20 p
Using other algorithm (e.g., with stack) and getting different answer because of this): -10 p
Not lexicographic order of neighbours: -1 p [i.e., very minor issue]

PROBLEM 3b (30 p)
Minor mistakes during graph traversal: -10 p
Wrong terminology, e.g. talking about discovery time & finish time for BFS to refer to distance: -10 p
Overall correct approach but some mistakes: -15 p
Correct spanning tree but almost all details missing: -20 p
Not lexicographic order of neighbours: -1 p [i.e., very minor issue]

PROBLEM 3c (20 p)
For a full score we want to see a clear answer that BFS and Dijkstra is the same in this case but that there is no relation to DFS.
Realizing and motivating that BFS and Dijkstra are the same: 10 p
Realizing and motivating that there is no relation betwen DFS and Dijkstra: 10 p
