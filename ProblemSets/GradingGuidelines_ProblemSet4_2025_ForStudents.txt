Grading guidelines for DMFS 2022 problem set 4


PROBLEM 1

PROBLEM 1a (30 p)
Fully correct DFS for G with discovery and finishing times plus explanations 15 p
Fully correct DFS for G^T with explanations 10 p
Fully correct output of strongly connected components 5 p
Missing DFS spanning tree for G -5 p
Missing DFS spanning tree for G^T -5 p [this can be deducted for both G and G^T]
Mostly correct DFS for G but no other significant contributions 10 p
Just pictures without explanations of what is going on 0 p
Visiting out-neighbours not in alphabetic order --- no deduction, as long as end result is the same (which it should be)
Discovery and finishing time missing for DFS of G^T --- no deduction
Starting and finishing times start from 0; or start from 1 --- both OK, as long as solution is consistent

PROBLEM 1b (30 p)
Fully correct explanation of why the claim is correct 15 p
Algorithm in time O(n^4) with correct complexity analysis 15 p
Mostly but not fully correct explanation of why the claim is correct 10 p
Answer that claim is correct with somewhat convincing argument that starts out in the right direction 5 p
Just answering that claim is correct; no explanation -15 p [so none of the 15 p of the "explanation part"]
Convincing proof that (A_G)_{\odot}^{t} indicates paths of length exactly t, or at least something along those lines, but nothing more 5 p
Convincing proof that OR_{i=1}^{\infty} (A_G)_{\odot}^{i} is reachability matrix for G but nothing more 10 p
Algorithm in polynomial time but no clear analysis of exponent or worse than n^4 10 p
Algorithm in finite time but without complexity analysis 5 p


PROBLEM 2

PROBLEM 2a (30 p)
Minor mistakes building MST -5p
Some missing/wrong details building MST but overall correct and with convincing explanations -10p
Some missing/wrong details but overall correct; however, explanations quite poor -20p
Just pictures without explanations of what is going on 0 p
Inspecting edges not in alphabetic order --- no deduction, as long as end result is the same (which it should be)

PROBLEM 2b (10 p)
Correct answer; shaky/wrong motivation -5p
Correct answer; clearly wrong motivation 0 p

PROBLEM 2c (20 p)
Correct answer; shaky motivation -10p
Correct answer; clearly wrong motivation 0 p

PROBLEM 2d (20 p)
Correct answer; shaky motivation -10p
Correct answer; clearly wrong motivation 0 p


PROBLEM 3

PROBLEM 3a (60 p; correct heap 20 p, correct algorithm with relaxing 30 p, correct SSSP tree 10 p)
Completely missing heap and/or completely misunderstood heap representation: -20 p
Heap only updated once all relaxations have been made for a dequeued vertex (and so becomes incorrect): -15 p
Partially missing details for heap: -10 p
No details on "relax" operations: -20 p
Partially missing or wrong details for relax operations (e.g., failing to explain/point out that edges (c,e) and (d,g) do not lead to updates): -10 p
Partially missing details for shortest paths tree: -5 p
More substanial missing details for shortest paths tree: -10 p
Refers to the queue as a stack: -5 p
Deviations due to non-lexicographic order of neighbours --- very minor -1p

PROBLEM 3b (10 p)
Vague (or wrong) explanation not clearly related to problem: 0 p

PROBLEM 3c (10 p)
Vague (or wrong) explanation not clearly related to problem: 0 p
Answers "yes" but argues by referring to MST: 0 p

PROBLEM 3d (20 p; 15 p for correct solution, 5 p for time complexity)
Vague (or wrong) algorithm not clearly related to problem: -15 p
Wrong or missing time complexity: -5 p
Off-by-one error in calculation of new path "length": -5 p
Partially correct algorithm, but wrong details: -10 p
Completely missing motivation: -15 p
