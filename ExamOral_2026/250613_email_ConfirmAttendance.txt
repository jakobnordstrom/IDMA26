PLEASE CONFIRM that you will attend the IDMA oral exam Mon Jun 30 (or possibly Wed Jun 25)

Hi all,

This message is being sent to you who have registered for the oral re-exam in June for the Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms (IDMA) course. The reason for sending out this message that there are often up to one-third of no-shows at the oral exam, and this makes the planning a bit challenging. It greatly simplifies matters for us to know in advance which students will actually show up.

Please respond to this message as soon as possible (by private reply) to let us know if you intend to take the oral re-exam or not. Also, please let us know if the intended exam date of June 30 works for you, or if there are compelling reasons for you to want to do the exam on June 25.

Also, if you know someone on the list of recipients who might not be able to access KU e-mail at present, then please help us by alerting this person.

Regarding the exam date, the information that has been given consistently throughout the course, and had been cleared with course administration before the course, is that the oral re-exam should be held on Monday June 30. Apparently, course administration had not noted this change in a proper way in their system, and has therefore sent  out a message to you asking if you instead wanted to do the exam on Wednesday June 25 instead (which was the date set long ago, before I checked with study administration that we could change it).

We would very much appreciate if we could do all exams on Monday June 30. However, if you really need to do the exam on Wednesday June 25 instead, please do let us know, and we will solve this.

Again, if your plans have changed after registering, so that you will not attend the exam, then we are asking that you let us know about this as soon as possible, and otherwise that you confirm that you are indeed coming. Thanks for your assistance and understanding, and good luck on the exam!

Best regards,
Jakob
