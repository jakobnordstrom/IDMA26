Re-exam for IDMA 2025 on Monday June 30

Kære alle,

Following up on the correspondence below from last autumn regarding the re-exam date for the Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms course, I have communicated to my students at several times during the course, in class and on Absalon, that the plan is to have the re-exam on Monday June 30. Everybody has been fine with this, with no questions or concerns raised.

It would be very convenient if the IDMA re-exam date could be officially changed to June 30 in the administrative systems as well, as per the most recent message below.

Needless to say, if it would nevertheless turn out that the change of exam date would cause any problems for any students, then we will accommodate all such students as needed.

Venlig hilsen
Jakob Nordström

Kære Jakob,

It is possible to arrange an alternative re-exam date if it accommodates all students and they agree to it.

Science Exam Office will be notified that the re-exam date has been changed by agreement with the students. You can officially announce it on Absalon (or the communication platform with the students).

If the request for another re-exam date is because you are not at the department, there is an option to conduct the exam online. However, only you as the course organizer may be online. The students and the examiner must be present on-site.

Let me know what you agree upon with the students.

De bedste hilsner
