\section*{Learning Goals}

You are expected to be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
 Understand what min- and max-heaps are,  to 
%    be able to 
 determine
whether an object is a min- or max-heap, and to reason about
properties of heaps.

\item 
  Build and operate on heaps using the methods presented in class and
in Chapter 6 (including giving detailed descriptions of why and how the
heap changes as a result of these operations).

\item 
Sort using heaps (and to describe why and how the
heap changes during sorting).

\item 
Build and operate on priority queues
using the methods presented in class and
in Chapter 6 (including giving detailed descriptions of why and how the
operations affect the data structure).

\item
Understand what minimum spanning trees (MSTs) are and to reason about
  their properties.

\item
Construct a minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm
  (including describing in detail why and how the data structures change
  during the course of the algorithm).

\item
Construct a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm
  (including describing the process in detail, except for that details
  of how set operations are performed need not be covered).


\end{itemize}
