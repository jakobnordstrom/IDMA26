Reminder about the course evaluation

Hi all,

This is just a reminder for all of you to go to https://evaluering.ku.dk and fill in the course evaluation. We need your answers by Friday April 12 before midnight.

If there were aspects of the course that you think could or should be improved, then please let us know --- your feedback in this regard is very valuable.

Also, if there are things that you think should really stay the same, then it is equally important that you let us know about this as well, so that we don't try to fix what ain't broken.

Any comments you could provide would be very, very much appreciated!

Jakob

P.S. There are a couple of questions related to your exam preparations that might possibly be ever so slightly easier to answer after April 10. But all questions should make total sense already now, and it would be great if you could answer to as much of the evaluation as possible as soon as possible, to make sure that we get your answers.
