Reminder: Grades for all problem sets needed NOW

Hi all,

A few hours later than intended, I am starting to report IDMA exam eligibility.

With apologies for repeating information from several previous messages, what I need and expect to find for every student in the grading system right now is:
- For problem sets 1, 2, and 3, a final score.
- For problem set 4 either a final score or an integer in the range [0,2], where
  o 0 means not at all serious submission; could not pass the threshold in any universe (this should be rare, since it is essentially saying that the submission is equivalent to handing in a blank paper).
  o 1 means a serious submission; does not seem unreasonable that something like this might pass after a hypothetical resubmission (even if the score before resubmission might be bad).
  o 2 means that at least based on a quick look, this actually looks quite promising and potentially a first-round pass without resubmission.

For problem set 4, students should get their fully graded psets back by the morning of Tuesday April 1, so that they can use the TA feedback as they prepare for the exam. At this point, I also need to be able to see the actual score for pset 4 in the grading system.

I am aware that I am behind on some other IDMA correspondence, but I hope to be able to catch up later today or tomorrow.

Jakob
