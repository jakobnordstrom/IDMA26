Please encourage strong students to apply as TAs next year!

Hi all,

I should have written this earlier, but I hope it is better late than never...

As you are preparing to return the final pset solutions, please consider adding a note for the strongest students in terms of overall grades (say, 5 students per hold or so) that they are welcome and encouraged to apply for TA positions next year. Also, if you have the time and energy, I would be grateful for receiving short lists of names for any students who made a particularly good impression on you, and whom it might be appropriate to approach about TA-ships.

Your work as TAs are absolutely crucial for the success of this course, and we will need great TAs also in coming years!

And please provide your own feedback! [Fwd: Please encourage strong students to apply as TAs next year!]

My apologies --- stream-of-consciousness e-mailing...

Also, I would be very grateful for any feedback from your side --- now, or after we are done with the exam grading (about I hope to send a separate message in a near future. I am very interested in knowing if there is anything you think I should know about aspects of the course that could or should be changed for the better (or perhaps, on the contrary, kept as is).

Jakob
