All preparatory material for the exam now posted

Hi again,

This is just to confirm, as announced in the message yesterday, that all material that we can provide for your exam preparations has now been published on Absalon (most of it as of early Saturday morning or even earlier).

This includes:
- An overview of all topics covered on the course.
- Solutions to problem sets from 2023, 2024, and 2025.
- Detailed grading guidelines for the problem sets from 2025 (so that you can see in detail how we grade the type of problems that you will have on the exam).
- Solutions to the DMFS exams in 2022 and 2023.
- The first page of the IDMA 2025 exam.
- Detailed information about allowed exam aids and why we have these rules (also just sent out as an announcement).

You can expect to get your graded solutions to problem set 4 back on Tuesday morning.

On Tuesday morning is also when I would expect administration to have recorded your eligibility for the exam. If this works as in previous years, then if you meet the requirements to be eligible for the exam, you should be able to go into Kunet and see where the exam is held and what your exam ID is:
- 'Selvbetjening'
- 'Eksamensplan - Tid og sted': 'Øvrige skriftlige stedprøver'
- Sign in with your KU-ID
- 'Se oversigt over eksamen'
- Allow pop-up

At the bottom of the list, you should see some letters and numbers and then "Introduction to Discrete Math and Algorithms" or something similar, which is the row containing your exam ID, location, and time of the exam.

Again, good luck with the final preparations for the exam! 

Jakob
