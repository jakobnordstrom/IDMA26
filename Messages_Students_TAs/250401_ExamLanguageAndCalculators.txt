Exam language and calculators

Hi again,

You can write your answers to the IDMA exam problems in either English or Danish.

You will not need (and should not use) calculators or similar for the exam. If the correct answer to a problem is 42!, for instance, then we expect you to answer in this form and not expanded out as 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000.
