Hej,

Indeed, there is an error here. I can see in the files that have been sent off to administration that you are marked as inelibigle (MF), but this is wrong.

You can respond to administration that there has been a mistake and that you are eligible for the IDMA exam.

I have also sent them a separate message to this effect.

I apologize for this, but as I already wrote in my message last weekend the system for reporting exam eligibility is not great, which unfortunately means that one or two mistakes happen every year.

Venlig hilsen
Jakob

Correction [SV: Tilmeldingsliste Blok 3 ordinær eksamen 2024/2025 NDAB23K02E og NDAB23002E Introduktion til diskret matem: deadline: 24. marts]

Kære Hanne,

Unfortunately, I have discovered two errors in the exam list for IDMA. The two students
- TCP541 Ismaili, Jora
- PVL691 Mikkelsen, Sebastian Just

should be marked as ELIGIBLE to take the IDMA exam tomorrow.

I am sorry about this mistake.

Venlig hilsen

Mange tak!

One more correction is that Oliver Ringgaard (vqd525) should also be eligible. (I hope and believe that this is the last correction, but let's see...)

Venlig hilsen
Jakob
