is quite an interesting LinkedIn post highlighting the importance of developing your own creative and critical thinking rather than relying on generative AI.

This is what I hope this course will really give you the opportunity to learn. And the more you rely on your own hard work, rather than on taking AI shortcuts, the better off you will be in the long run. I don't mean to sound hyperbolic, but this is a strategic choice that you make that will have a major, major impact on the rest of your life (professional and personal).
