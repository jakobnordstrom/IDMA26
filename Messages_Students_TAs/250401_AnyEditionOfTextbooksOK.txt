Any edition of the official textbooks is fine

Hi all,

In response to questions, any edition of the two official textbooks on the IDMA course are fine to bring to the exam.

For CLRS, this means that not only the 4th but also the 3rd edition (or earlier editions) can be used.

For KBR, you don't need to have the special University of Copenhagen edition --- if you have the full textbook, then this is also fine.
