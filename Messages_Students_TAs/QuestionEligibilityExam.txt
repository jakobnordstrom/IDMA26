Question about eligibility for IDMA 2025 exam

Hi,

I am reporting eligibility for the IDMA 2025 exam today.

You appear on the list of people registered for the exam only with your KU username, and I am not able to find any problem set submissions with this username on Absalon.

For now, I will therefore have to report that you are *not* eligible for the exam. If this is wrong, please help me either by clarifying which IDMA 2025 problem set submissions are yours or by giving me enough information so that I can verify that you were eligible already for the IDMA 2024 exam if that is the case.

Best regards, / Venlig hilsen
Jakob Nordström
