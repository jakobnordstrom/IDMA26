Preparing for the third week of IDMA 2025

Hi all,

Just a quick heads-up as we are entering the third week of the IDMA course.

LECTURES AND INDEPENDENT READING

Last week we started doing proper mathematical proofs, but we still needed to discuss at times what we actually meant by a "proof".

This week, we will try to clarify this by quickly reviewing the foundations of logical reasoning. As already mentioned last week, we will have a lot to cover, and you are highly, highly recommended to prepare for the lectures by reading through the textbook in advance (especially since we are looking forward to yet another Wonderful Wednesday, when a full day of lectures will make sure to fry our brains).

PROBLEM SET PLANNING

Here is a timeline for what will happen regarding problem sets:

On Wednesday February 19, we hope to return your graded solutions to problem set 1.

In the (purely hypothetical) event that you didn't pass, you have a week to revise your solutions and resubmit at the latest by midnight on Wednesday February 26.

Before the lecture that same Wednesday February 26, your solutions to problem set 2 are due.

As you plan your work on the problem sets, please do the following:
- First do some exercises as suggested in the weekly plans, to make sure that you understand the basics of what was taught in class and what you have read in the textbook.
- Then look at old problem sets, which will contain similar problems, and try to solve them.
- Throughout this process, interact as much as possible with your TAs, who, in particular, can help you with answers to all previous problem set problems, and can also go over such solutions on the board during the exercise classes if you ask nicely.
- Finally, work out the solutions to the problem set problems this year, which will be a breeze once you have followed the steps above! ;-)

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow Monday!

Jakob
