Pen or pencil on the IDMA exam?

Hi all,

I am getting some questions about writing tools for the exam.

When you are writing your solutions for the IDMA exam problems, you can use either pen or pencil.

As long as we can read your solutions, any writing tool is fine.

As a reminder, you can expect to get your solutions to problem set 4 back tomorrow Tuesday morning, and that is also when the KU IT systems can be expected to show your exam eligibility.
