Schedule, reading material, et cetera

Hi all,

Some quick pieces of information.

SCHEDULE AND COURSE INFORMATION

As previously announced, the official course information with the schedule can be found on Absalon at https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/80492/files/9310261?module_item_id=2632608 . You do not need to send any questions about the schedule --- the information you need about the lectures is in there.

READING MATERIAL

Please note that for each week you need to check the weekly module for course material.

For the first week, many of you who asked questions on Monday did not seem to have read the notes on asymptotic analysis at https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/80492/files/9313249?module_item_id=2631705 .

For this week, it is highly, highly recommended (not to say compulsory) to read the notes on mathematical induction at https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/80492/files/9313258?module_item_id=2631712 .

PROBLEM SET 1 DUE BEFORE NEXT LECTURE

And, just to repeat information that you are all aware of, the first problem set is due in slightly less than 13 hours from now, before we meet next time.

Until then,
Jakob
