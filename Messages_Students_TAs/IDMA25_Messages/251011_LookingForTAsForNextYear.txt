DIKU looking for TAs for next year (application deadline Oct 19)

Hi all,

With apologies for the somewhat short forward notice, I wanted to let you know that DIKU is now looking for teaching assistants for the courses in block 3 and 4 in 2026.

Please see https://employment.ku.dk/teaching-positions/?show=164941 for more details. The application deadline is October 19.

If you have excellent grade transcripts and want to help make the courses at DIKU better, please don't hesitate to apply!

In particular, if you liked the IDMA course and did well on it, and want to make it an even better experience for the students next year, then please send in your application and mention that you want to help out with IDMA!

Best regards,
Jakob
