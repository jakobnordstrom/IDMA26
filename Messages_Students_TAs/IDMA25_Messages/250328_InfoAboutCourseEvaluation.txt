Please fill in the course evaluation at evaluering.ku.dk

Hi all,

As the lectures and exercise classes are over, and you are making the final push before the exam, please don't forget to fill in the course evaluation at evaluering.ku.dk!

The course evaluation stays open until April 7, but please don't wait --- why not fill it in right away? We need your feedback to understand better what aspects of the course you liked, what we should try to keep the same, and where there is room for improvement.

Jakob
