IDMA: Exam grading guidelines and grading sheet

Hi all,

The grading guidelines are now available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/18eU-ZdrwSaPdMWTAaHA-2bITuvvbCautuUSPUMltuao/edit . As noted in the guidelines, quite a few problem types are new, and so I am not entirely sure what to expect --- this is one important reason why we are having a first hour of tentative grading.

The exam grading sheet is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11UoT9UpvebjL9GdIq6FWedVcSA000DiroFcIcPk5-B4/edit . Some comments about the grading sheet:
- You should not use this for the first round of tentative grading at 9 am, but only for the final grading once we have revised grading guidelines.
- You should only fill scores for the exames in the coloured cells, and not touch anything outside (except erasing or adding exam numbers as specified below).
- Please ignore the grades and grading thresholds --- they will be adjusted later.
- If some exam numbers are missing, insert then in the leftmost column.
- Importantly, please also remove exam numbers that are not in use. Do not fill these lines in with zeros or similar, because this will screw up the statistics.

We meet in the BARC kitchen at 9:00 am tomorrow Wednesday. The actual grading will be carried out in room N116A on the second floor of the north wing of Universitetsparken 1 (where the ML Section is).

If you would have any questions before tomorrow, or during the day tomorrow, send me an e-mail or text me at +45 28 78 38 11 / +46 70 742 21 98 (same cell phone, two different numbers).

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!
