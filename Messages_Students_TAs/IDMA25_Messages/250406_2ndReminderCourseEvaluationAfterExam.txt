We need your help!

Hi all,

I am sorry to bug you again, but...

We really need your help! Please, please go to evaluering.ku.dk and fill in the course evaluation!

The evaluation of the course proper closes tomorrow. We really want to hear what you think about the course, and to hear your thoughts about good or bad aspects of the lectures, exercise classes, problem sets, whatever. We will read your answers very carefully, and will make our best to use your feedback to (hopefully) improve the course for next year. 

The exam evaluation will stay open until Sunday April 13 at midnight, and we are more than grateful for all feedback on the exam also.

Jakob
