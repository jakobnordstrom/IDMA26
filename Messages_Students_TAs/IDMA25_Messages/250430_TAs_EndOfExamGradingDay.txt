Thanks for the good work!

Hi all,

Looking at the grading sheet and the grading guidelines, I am getting the sense that you have successfully completed your task today. Thanks for the good work!

I already told you to not pay too much attention to the auto-computed grades, but there is no denying that the exam scores this year look quite interesting. In particular, I am getting the sense that we have an unusually large number of quite strong students --- depending on how we will set the exact thresholds, it seems like 12 might well be the most common grade this year, and I am pretty sure that has never happened before.

Whenever you have the time, it would good to get an e-mail confirmation (copying Srikanth) that the grading has indeed been finished, and that the exams have been returned to Srikanth's or my office.

I have said that everything would be over once the exams were graded, and so I think I can now promise almost surely that that I will not bug you with any more IDMA messages in the foreseeable future. Except that:
- I will probably send out a reminder soliciting TA feedback on the course (regarding things to keep the same or improve for next year, or do completely differently). This will be completely voluntary, but I will be most grateful for any thoughts you will want to share.
- I will also try to remember to send you the student evaluations, but if I haven't done so within a week or so, then please remind me.

Thanks again for all your work on this course!

Jakob
