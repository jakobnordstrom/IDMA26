LaTeX Template for IDMA 2025: 5100-B3-3F25;Introduktion til diskret matematik og algoritmer

Hi everyone,

Since we want you to focus on the course content and learn as much as you can(!), I have created a LaTeX template for you in Overleaf such that you won't have to spend too much time on practicalities, while still handing in a beautiful and well made submission.

When you open the document, you can create your own personal copy by clicking Menu in the upper left corner, and then Copy Project:

It's not mandatory to use the template, however I highly recommend it, and I hope it might make your life as students just a little bit easier while also making it faster for us to grade :)!

 
Good luck on the problem sets!
