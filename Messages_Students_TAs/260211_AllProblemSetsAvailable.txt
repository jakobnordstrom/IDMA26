All problem sets posted on Absalon

Hi all,

This is just to let you know that all problem sets for the IDMA 2026 course have now been posted on Absalon and should be possible to view for you. Please let me know if anything seems wrong (ideally by sending a message on Absalon, which is a surer way of reaching me than, e.g., commenting on this post).

Please note again that we do not expect the deadlines for future problem sets to shift, so please plan accordingly and make sure to submit your problem set solutions strictly on time.

Another important detail that I want to highlight is that problem sets 2 and 4 are currently posted as draft versions. What this means is that all problems currently on the problem sets will remain on the problem sets in the form stated, but we might add one or two problems (all in the interest of helping you to prepare better for the exam).

As you will be well aware by now if you have followed the instructions to study carefully the wealth of material available to you on Absalon, ;-) you also have access to problem sets for previous years. The teaching assistants can go over the solutions to old problems with you, although you might get the most out of this if you first make a serious attempt to solve the problems yourself --- in this way, you will learn much more when seeing the solutions.
