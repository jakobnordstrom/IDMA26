
IDMA planning for week 10

Hi Amir,

Apologies in advance if I am repeating things from other messages, but I felt I wanted to have this collected in one message with a descriptive subject line to be sure that we have communicated about this and are on the same page.

Please confirm to me that you have received this message, and let me know if what follows below sounds OK or if we should talk about anything!

On IDMA, you will do the following lectures:
- Monday March 2 13:15-15:00 in Lundbeck Auditoriet, Biocenter, Ole Maaløes Vej 5
- Wednesday March 4 10:15-12:00 in Aud 01, H.C. Ørsted Building, Universitetsparken 5
- Wednesday March 4 13:15-15:00 in Aud 01, H.C. Ørsted Building, Universitetsparken 5

As per the attached course planning, the topics of these lectures are relations (including functions), trees, and partial orders.

I can share the relevant textbook chapters with you, but I really don't use it much.

I attach my lecture notes just to give you a sense of what I try to cover:
- Basics of matrix algebra (if I haven't gotten there before).
- Boolean matrices.
- Graphs represented as adjacency matrices, and what it means to multiply such adjacency matrices.
- Cartesian products.
- Basic properties of relations (symmetry, reflexivity, transitivity) and ways to represent relations.
- Functions and notions like injectivity, surjectivity, bijectivity.
- Equivalence relations and proofs that they correspond to partitions (this students find challenging).
- Operations on relations such as union, intersection, complement, inverse relation, closures w.r.t. symmetry, transitivity, reflexivity.
- Partially ordered sets.
- Hasse diagrams.
- Lattices.
- Basic properties of directed trees, in particular, that the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices and that there are no cycles.

This is a lot of material, and I usually struggle to cover all of it. Hasse diagrams and lattices I do very superficially --- maybe this should just be skipped. I will be happy to talk about it.
