Hold adjustment

Hi all,

Administration has how adjusted the number of exercise groups (hold), so that the number of groups match the number of TAs.

As communicated previously, this has no implications for which exercise session you actually attend. Please feel free to try out different classes and to find a TA session that works well for you.

The reason for adjusting the groups is that we need to balance the workload for the TAs with regard to problem set grading, which is one of the most time-consuming tasks on the course.

Administration warns us that when the groups are updated on Absalon, which will happen "within a couple of days", some students may temporarily lose access to Absalon.

Therefore, just to be on the safe side, make sure to download local copies from Absalon of any course material you need for this week.

On behalf of UCPH administration, I apologize for the extra hassle. Unfortunately, this kind of administrative aspects of the course are firmly outside of my control.

Jakob
