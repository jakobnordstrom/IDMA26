GRADING GUIDELINES FOR DMFS EXAM APRIL 2, 2025
===============================================

PAGE TITLE

Exam solutions, grading guidelines, and statistics for the IDMA exam April 2, 2025

PAGE CONTENTS

For reference, here are PDF copies of the IDMA exam on April 2, 2025 and of suggested solutions to the exam problems. Statistics for the exam results and grading guidelines follow below.


GENERAL COMMENTS

Please note that just giving the right answer is never enough unless explicitly stated otherwise. Normally, just stating a correct solution without explanation gives zero points. Students have to provide explanations of how they solved the problems and why their solutions are correct. Just referring to a figure or table or whatever is not enough (although if some kind of material that partly explains the answer has been given, then this material should be graded and can give points).
