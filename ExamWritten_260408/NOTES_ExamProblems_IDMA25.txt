[No pseudocode problem in 2025!]


PROBLEM SUMMARIES
-----------------


1. NUMBER REPRESENTATION

- Write the binary number 110 in decimal notation.
- Write the decimal number 110 in binary notation.
- Suppose that 2025 is an octal number. Write it in decimal notation.


2. EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM

Determine d = gcd(M, N) and write d as a linear combination of M and N.

The problem statement is intentionally generic, so that students will have to understand themselves that the Euclidean algorithm is what they should use for this.

(a) M = 38, N = 14

38 = 2 * 14 + 10
14 = 1 * 10 +  4
10 = 2 *  4 +  2
4  = 2 *  2 +  0
gcd (38, 14) = 2
These numbers are small enough that the students should be able to find the right answer by brute force, for which we can give partial credit

(b) M = 117, N = 69

117 = 1 * 69 + 48
 69 = 1 * 48 + 21
 48 = 2 * 21 + 6
 21 = 3 *  6 + 3
  6 = 2 *  3 + 0
gcd(117, 69) = 3
These numbers are large enough that students probably need to use the algorithm.


3. SIMPLE INDUCTION PROBLEMS

(a)Define a_1 = 1, a_n = 2 a_{n-1} + 1. Prove that for all n a_n = 2^n - 1.

(b) Prove that for all n >= 0 the number 4^n + 5 is divisible by 3

Induction step:
4^{n+1} + 5 = 
4 * 4^{n} + 5 = 
3 * 4^{n} + (4^n + 5) 


4. RELATIONS

Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and consider the following binary relations on A:

R = { (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) }
S = { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) }
T = { (1,1), (1, 4), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,4) }

(a) For each relation, determine whether it is:
- reflexive,
- symmetric,
- antisymmetric,
- transitive.

Make sure to explain, briefly but clearly, what these properties mean and why they are satisfied if they are. For any relation that fails to satisfy a property, make sure to provide a specific counterexample.

R: Antisymmetric, transitive (greater-than).
S: Everything (identity).
T: Reflexive, symmetric, transitive.

(c) Which of the relations, if any, are equivalence relations or partial orders? Justify your answers.

R: None.
S: Equivalence relation and partial order (for vacuous reasons).
T: Equivalence relation.


5. LOGIC

Ask whether formulas are tautologies, or can be patched by adding a single connective to make them tautologies.

(a) Tautology.

(b) Make into tautology by negating q on either side of the equivalence.


6. TRICKY INDUCTION

Prove that the Fibonacci numbers F_{n+1} and F_n are relatively prime, and that for n >= 2 the Euclidean algorithm for F_{n+1} and F_n makes n-1 recursive calls.

F_{n+1} divided by F_n leaves remainder F_{n-1}, so if the students realize this the proof is very straightforward. But this might be hard to see.


7. COMBINATORICS

Selecting ordered and unordered sets.

(a) 3! * 3! * 2 ways of lining up for the photo.

(b) 1 * 2 * 3 ways to select the committe:
- Susanna has to be a member.
- Exactly one of Nutan and Paloma due to gender balance.
- Select whom of Amir, Jakob, and Srikanth to exclude.

8. TRAVEL DIRECTIONS

This is just a shortest path problem.
Students should model this as an undirected graph and then run Dijkstra's algorithm.
The best route is (I think):
Kastrup -- Kongens Nytorv -- Københavns H -- Nørreport -- Universitetsparken.


9. OUTPUT FROM DIFFERENT GRAPH ALGORITHMS

Sequence 1: Dijkstra shortest path starting in a.
Sequence 2: BFS starting in a.
Sequence 3: Spoiler sequence.
Sequence 4: DFS starting in a.



PROBLEMS TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE
===============================

Some induction problem from Vaderlind?
Some combinatorics problem from Vaderlind?

GRAPHS

Can we find a "real-world problem" that students should model as an MST problem and then solve?
Maybe automated delivery of paper mail between buildings on Norre Campus?

Maybe strongly connected components:
- Start with directed graph and view graph as edge relation.
- Maybe even give small graph on 6 or 7 vertices as example
- Take transitive closure T  of this relation. What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Take reflexive closure R of (a). What is this? Give matrix representation.
- Define new relation S(u,v) such at S(u,v) holds precisely with R(u,v) and R(v,u) holds. This gives a particular type of relation that we discussed in class. What is this type of relation called? Prove that we indeed get this type of relation.
- In fact, we have even seen an algorithm for computing this relation. Run this algorithm on our small example graph, in the same way as we did in class, 
But this is probably very hard...
